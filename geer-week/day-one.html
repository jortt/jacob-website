						The first night went smoothly except for one issue that I had not foreseen: Static Electricity.  If you have ever sat on the computer
						engineering club room's couch then you know what I am talking about.  It is like having a Van de Graaff generator attached to your ass,
						constantly pumping you full of charge.  We have tried grounding it but none of our efforts seem to ease the problem.  It is tough to
						sleep when you lean over in the night to get a glass of water and shock yourself multiple times on an

						assorted objects.  So far I have
						been shocked by the tables, chairs, the doorhandle, the refrigerator, and my greatest nemesis of all: the filing cabinet.  I
						have never liked filing cabinets.  I think they are ugly, outdated, and I even question their effectiveness as an organizational system.
						Usually I live in peace with filing cabinets.  I don't mess with them and they don't mess with me.  This one feels the need to break
						that truce by shocking me every time I roll over.  There is a special circle in hell for filing cabinets like this one.  I am planning
						to get my hands on a static bracelet and hopefully that will end this problem.

							During my first night I have learned many things that I did not know about ETLC.  Most notably the building has a very odd lighting
							schedule.  At 10:00 the lights in the club rooms flash off and back on again.  I think this is meant to be a warning that it is now
							after hours.  Ten minutes later the lights just turn off.  But you can still turn them back on again if you want by hitting the switch.
							This is the	second warning to say that you should be leaving.
							The final stage is at midnight when the lights in the hallways all go out.  I have no idea who came up with this system but it
							is clear that nobody pays attention to it.  ETLC is still full of life until midnight so clearly the 10:00 warnings are not very
							effective. <br/>

				Upon waking up this morning I also found the building to be inhabited by a swarm of penguins.  It is still early so I am not sure if they are
				in my head or not.  My first thought is that they may be like the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Thestral">Thestral</a> from Harry
				Potter.  They may only reveal themselves to those that have spent a night in the building.  Do other people see the penguins or is it just me?
