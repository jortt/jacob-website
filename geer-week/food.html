			<p>
				I planned to write this post about what I have brought to eat this week however I feel like I need to side-track a little first.  The
				Computer Engineering Club came in second in the Tug-O-War!!!  This was very surprising to everyone involved because we have a long
				history of losing every match.  This year it was different and we won four glorious battles to make it to the final against the Mining
				Engineers.  We lost the final but still got far more points than we expected.  Good job to all the Computer Engineers that fought hard.

			<h2 class="content-subhead">Nutritional Advice For All</h2>
			<p>
				My goal for this week is to buy as little food as possible at the university so I have bought a lot of cheap food beforehand.  I tried
				to follow Canada's food guide.  Let me know how close I was.  I hope this is enough food but if it is not then I will have to get my
				sister to bail me out and bring me supplies.

							Grain Products: <br/><br/>
							
							I have two boxes of dry cereal for breakfast.  "Why dry cereal?" you may ask.  Because then I can eat it out of the box and
							not need to wash dishes.  Washing a dish requires me to go to the bathroom, which is one unnecessary unprotected trip
							through the hallways.  So dry cereal it is.

							Fruits and Vegetables: <br/><br/>
							
							The fruits and vegetables department is pretty sparse.  I have a bag of apples for the fruit department.  I wanted to bring
							some bananas too but superstore was all out.  How does superstore run out of bananas?  I also have orange juice to prevent
							scurvy.  There was a case of scurvy in the U of A residence a couple of years ago and now I am paranoid that I won't get
							enough vitamin C.  I am short on vegetables but who needs them really?

							Protein: <br/><br/>
							
							I struggled to find a good form of protein for the week because I am not cooking.  I don't think that this is a problem 
							though because almost all North Americans eat more protein than they need.  Most of us overestimate how much protein we
							should be eating.  I brought along a hefty supply of hummus for this and some protein shakes.

							Frozen dinners should always be a staple of every diet.  I keep waiting for Health Canada to add it to the Canada Food Guide but

            <h2 class="content-subhead">The First Signs of Weakness</h2>
            
			<p>
				I woke up from my first night with a sore back.  I didn't think it was much until we went to the Tug-O-War.  During an epic
				match against the PetEs I threw out my back pretty bad.  I expected my body to deteriorate during the week but I didn't
				expect it to happen so soon.  I ended up missing my next class lying on the floor in pain.  Alcohol and pain killers eventually,
				got me on my feet for the rest of the day but I think that I am going to have to take it easy tomorrow and have a recovery day.
