							This blog has now become my only contact with the outside world.  This morning I woke up with a shock from the filing
							cabinet of doom (I have moved back to the couch) and opened my door to go outside.  When I opened the door I found another
							wall on the other side.  The second wall is grey and very sticky.  I can only assume that I was expected to
							walk into it and get stuck, like a fly in a spider's web.  There appears to be no way in or out any more.  I can now only
							sit in this room and ponder the existence of the wall.  How long has the wall been there?  Was the grey wall always there?
							How long have I been in this room?  Was I always in this room?

							I have to believe that there is a world outside of this room.  This was done to me on purpose by someone or something.
							I strongly suspect that the filing cabient is behind it somehow.  I don't know when it did it or how, but I know it was
							behind it.  It is practically laughing at me right now as I sit in this room.  I will have my revenge one way or another.
							I will have my revenge.

				Before the grey wall appeared I took part in a beer tasting competition.  Each of the clubs submitted a home brewed beer and one member
				to judge the beers.  I brewed my club's beer and I also went to judge the other beers.  Beforehand I tried my beer and I was very
				disappointed with it.  I even made a second batch to improve upon it.  I had other computer engineers do a taste test of my two batches
				of beer and decide which was better.  They told me that the first batch was the better so I submitted it.  The judging for the competition
				was done as a blind taste test.  Each beer was randomly given a number and we ranked them.  When I was tasting the beers there was one
				that stuck out for me as the best.  I turned to Scott Hewson, sitting beside me, and said "This is exactly what I was trying to make.  
				Unfortunately I have tried mine and I know it isn't even close to this good".  After that, they revealed which beers correspond to which
				numbers.  The beer that I loved turned out to be my own.  This is a very good example of how easily our opinions are altered by personal
				bias.  I have a personal bias against anything that I make.  I always assume that it is not good enough.  When I tasted the beer and thought
				it was mine I didn't like it but when I thought it was someone else's I loved it.  The tastes that I remember for the two times that I had
				the beer are completely different.  It is really quite amazing how much of taste has nothing to do with the food/drink.
