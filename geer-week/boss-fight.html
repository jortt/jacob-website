			<p>
				As the week draws to an end I am closer and closer to freedom.  The grey wall has been removed now.  I don't know how it
				was removed but I assume that the invisible men had something to do with it.  As I get closer to freedom I am trying to
				remember what the outside world looks like.  All I can remember is that it is cold and dark.  I'm not sure what it was that
				I liked about the outside world before.  I have everything that I need in here.  If it was my choice I would stay but the
				other members of the club tell me I should go home.  They keep using phrases like "Get some help Jacob.", "You really need
				to get outside.", and "Please leave the club room. You are creeping out our guests".

							 It seems then that the time has come for me to leave, but I cannot leave yet.  The terrorist that has been causing
							 havoc since the start must be taken down.  I cannot allow him to continue terrorizing computer engineers.  There is
							 something that I must do for the sake of all present and future Computer Engineering Students.  THE FILING CABINET
							 MUST BE DEFEATED!!!!

				I now realize that I did not choose this mission for myself.  It was written in time before it even began.  Even though I do not want to leave,
				I know that I must.  My mission is over; I must go outside and face the cold harsh world.  Goodbye ETLC.  You still have many great mysteries
				that I have not yet discovered but it seems that fate has decreed for them to remain mysteries.
