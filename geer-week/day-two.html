						<p>
							Due to injuring my back in the Tug-O-War I didn't want to sleep on the couch.  I decided to sleep on the floor to try
							to help my back recover.  This had the added bonus of getting me further away from the filing cabinet of doom.  This
							worked fairly well except for when someone turned on the lights in the hallway at 2 in the morning.  I was pretty sure that I was about to
							get pranked and i couldn't go back to sleep for almost an hour.  I have accepted at this point that someone will prank
							me this week.  I have drawn too much attention to myself with this blog.  It isn't a question of "if" any more, it is 
							a question of "when".

			<h2 class="content-subhead">Paranoia and Showers</h2>
			<p>
				A lot of people have asked me if I am showering during this.  I am going to try to discuss showering in a way that doesn't give away 
				when or where I do it so I don't give my wannabe captors any hints.  I do shower every day.  It is the most stressful part of my day.
				I do it alone and at a different time every night.  There is usually just cleaning crew around on campus but I still enter a heightened
				state of paranoia every time I walk through the hallways.  Today I was walking back to ETLC outside when I heard footsteps and talking
				behind me.  It was probably just cleaning staff but I couldn't be sure so I just turned a corner and walked in a random direction until
				I was safe.  The whole experience is very stressful and I do not enjoy it at all.
