            <h2 class="content-subhead">How not to get captured as a PR rep</h2>
			<p>
				So far my methods of avoiding capture have been very successful.  I have decided that I will share some of these methods with my blog
				readers so that they too can be as successful.  The main weapon that we have developed for the Computer Engineering Arsenal that I would
				like to share is called "The Leash".  The leash works by limiting one thing: carelessness.  For anyone who does not know, the PR reps for
				each team have to stay within arm's reach of a team-mate or they can be captured by another team.  It is easy to stay within arms reach of
				a team-mate if you are paying attention, but as soon as you get careless and wander away, an opponent can strike.  This can be a pretty
				big issue if you are drunk.  The leash is a simple tether that can keep this from happening.

			<h2 class="content-subhead">Movie Night</h2>
			<p>
				Movie night was a ton of fun.  It is probably my favourite night of the year.  People seemed to like our movie which is great
				for us.  James had been working on the script since the end of Geer Week last year so it is good to know that it appears to have
				payed off.  I feel the need to congratulate Anders on an amazing job as well.  He does all of our editing and special effects but 
				was unable to come tonight.  He deserves a lot more credit than he gets.  Most importantly: WHO STOLE THE SD CARD???  We stopped 
				the movie right before the end and I really want to know. Could somebody in EE please contact me and let me know.
