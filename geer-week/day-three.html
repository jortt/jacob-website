						<p>
							Last night while doing some late night blogging, there was a knock on the door.  I went to answer it and I saw no body.  This
							was very odd because you would think that there must be a person at the door in order for someone to knock.  I shut the door,
							thinking that I was imagining things.  Then there was another knock on the door but still I could not see a person.  Using
							these two observations I came to a conclusion:<br/><br/>
							
							(I could not see a person) ^ (a person must have been at the door) ==> the person must be invisible.<br/><br/>
							
							After realizing this I let the invisible man into the room.  We had a very nice conversation about the previous days activities.
							He never said anything in this conversation, but I can only assume that he was listening because he texted me a picture (as seen
							on the right) part way through the conversation.  It was sent with the message "we see you".  I can now finally sleep relaxed
							knowing that there is a group of invisible men looking over me in the club room hallway.  I have faith that they will keep me
							safe from all harm.  I am also hoping that I can get some information regarding the penguins from these men.  They may be the 
							answer to all of the riddles that ETLC has been throwing at me ever since I moved in.

			<p>
				My shower schedule has been compromised.  This morning I got out of the club room to have a shower and found someone hiding and
				waiting for me.  Luckily I guessed that it would occur and arranged an escort in advance.  It was about time that someone caught
				on.  I will either have to completely rethink my shower schedule for the rest of the week or have an escort every time from now
				on.  I still have not been captured but I am starting to think that my luck is starting to run out.  We will see what the next two
				days have in store.
